# IVAO Aurora Profile per RWY Config
With this you can have a different profile per RWY Config

What this program can:
- Display different VORs, NDBs and FIXES per RWY Config
- Fill the active RWYs in Aurora depending on the RWY Config
- Fill the ATIS RWYs and Remarks depending on the RWY Config

For now, it only works in Germany if you have the german sector file installed and not for CTR profiles.
And also only on the Windows version of Aurora.

This project is WIP, documentation how to use it exactly will be added in the future.
As example how to use a config, there is my currently used config for EDDH_APP on this repository.
You can also add different configs for different profiles.

The python prompt to use it on Windows:<br>
<code>python program.py --rwyconfig "[Config per RWY name]" --configfile "[Config file name].txt"</code>

There are also Batch files given which give you the possibility to just doubleclick it and then Aurora opens with the RWY configuration prefilled.

If you found the project by yourself and want to use it now but don't know how to use it, feel free to contact me here:<br>
